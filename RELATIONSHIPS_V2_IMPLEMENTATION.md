**Feature:** Enhanced Relationships Section for Entry Detail V2  
**Implemented Features:** Bidirectional View, Relationship Grouping, Nested Hierarchy

---

## üéØ Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive relationships section to the Entry Detail V2 page with three major enhancements:

1. **Bidirectional Relationship View** - Tabs for outgoing and incoming relationships
2. **Relationship Type Grouping** - Organized display grouped by relationship type  
3. **Nested Relationship Display** - Tree view showing hierarchical parent-child relationships

---

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Backend Files

#### 1. **API Endpoints** - `/app/api/relationships_api.py`
Added three new endpoints:

```python
GET /api/entries/<entry_id>/relationships/incoming
GET /api/entries/<entry_id>/relationships/grouped  
GET /api/entries/<entry_id>/relationships/hierarchy
```

**Functions:**
- `get_incoming_relationships(entry_id)` - Returns relationships where entry is the target
- `get_grouped_relationships(entry_id)` - Returns outgoing relationships grouped by type
- `get_relationship_hierarchy(entry_id)` - Returns hierarchical tree structure

#### 2. **Route Handler** - `/app/routes/main_routes.py`
Modified the `entry_detail_v2` route (line ~350) to:
- Fetch outgoing relationships from `EntryRelationship` table
- Fetch incoming relationships (where entry is target)
- Group both by relationship type
- Pass all data to template via `relationships` dict

**Data Structure Passed to Template:**
```python
relationships = {
    'outgoing': [...],           # List of outgoing relationships
    'incoming': [...],           # List of incoming relationships
    'grouped_outgoing': {...},   # Dict grouped by type
    'grouped_incoming': {...},   # Dict grouped by type
    'outgoing_count': int,
    'incoming_count': int,
    'total_count': int
}
```

### Frontend Files

#### 3. **Main Section Template** - `/app/templates/sections/_relationships_section.html`
- Bootstrap tabs for Outgoing/Incoming/Hierarchy views
- Grouped relationship display
- Empty states and loading states
- Integration with add relationship modal

**Structure:**
```html
<div class="relationships-section">
  <div class="section-header">...</div>
  <div class="section-content">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">...</ul>
    <div class="tab-content">
      <div id="outgoing-tab">...</div>

      <div id="hierarchy-tab">...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 4. **Relationship Card Component** - `/app/templates/sections/_relationship_card.html`
Reusable card component showing:
- Entry type badge with color
- Relationship type label with direction icon
- Entry title link (opens in new tab)
- Status badge
- Quantity/unit metadata

- Expand/collapse buttons for nodes with children
- Current entry and parent badges
- Status indicators

#### 6. **Add Relationship Modal** - `/app/templates/modals/_add_relationship_modal.html`
Simplified modal for adding relationships:
- Relationship definition selector
- Entry search/select dropdown
- "Create new entry" toggle with fields
- Quantity/unit fields (conditional display)
- Integration with JavaScript handlers

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Outgoing Relationships
```
User visits /entry/123/v2
  ‚Üì
main_routes.py queries EntryRelationship WHERE source_entry_id = 123
  ‚Üì
Groups by relationship_type
  ‚Üì
Passes to template as relationships.grouped_outgoing
  ‚Üì
Template renders cards in groups
```

### Incoming Relationships
```
Same as above but WHERE target_entry_id = 123
  ‚Üì
Uses label_to_side for relationship type (reverse perspective)
  ‚Üì
Passes to template as relationships.grouped_incoming
```

### Hierarchy (Lazy Loaded)
```
User clicks "Hierarchy" tab
  ‚Üì
JavaScript calls GET /api/entries/123/relationships/hierarchy
  ‚Üì
Backend recursively builds tree (max depth 3)
  ‚Üì
Returns JSON hierarchy structure
  ‚Üì
JavaScript renders tree with renderTreeNode()
  ‚Üì
User can expand/collapse nodes
```

## üìä Database Queries

### Outgoing Relationships Query
```sql
SELECT
    er.id AS relationship_id,
    er.target_entry_id AS related_entry_id,
    e_to.title AS related_entry_title,
    e_to.status AS related_entry_status,
    et_to.id AS related_entry_type_id,
    et_to.singular_label AS related_entry_type_label,
    et_to.icon AS related_entry_type_icon,
    et_to.color AS related_entry_type_color,
    rd.id AS definition_id,
    rd.name AS definition_name,
    rd.label_from_side AS relationship_type,
    er.quantity,
    er.unit
FROM EntryRelationship er
JOIN RelationshipDefinition rd ON er.relationship_type = rd.id
JOIN Entry e_to ON er.target_entry_id = e_to.id
JOIN EntryType et_to ON e_to.entry_type_id = et_to.id
WHERE er.source_entry_id = ?
ORDER BY rd.name, e_to.title
```

### Incoming Relationships Query
```sql
-- Same as above but:
WHERE er.target_entry_id = ?
-- And uses label_to_side instead of label_from_side
```

### Hierarchy Query
Recursive function in Python that:
1. Starts with current entry or its parents
2. Finds child relationships (label_from_side LIKE '%Parent%')
3. Recursively builds tree up to max_depth (default 3)
4. Prevents circular references with visited set

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] View entry with outgoing relationships only
- [ ] View entry with incoming relationships only
- [ ] View entry with both outgoing and incoming
- [ ] View entry with no relationships (empty state)
- [ ] Click between tabs (verify counts match)
- [ ] Load hierarchy tab (verify AJAX call)
- [ ] Expand/collapse tree nodes
- [ ] Delete a relationship (verify confirmation)
- [ ] Open related entry in new tab
- [ ] Test on mobile (responsive layout)
- [ ] Test in dark mode
- [ ] Test with deeply nested hierarchies (3+ levels)
- [ ] Test grouped view with multiple types
- [ ] Verify quantity/unit display when present

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following were planned but not included in this phase:

- Visual relationship graph (D3.js/vis.js network diagram)
- Bulk relationship management (multi-select, bulk delete)
- Relationship templates
- Relationship history/audit trail
- Smart AI suggestions
- Relationship statistics cards
- Quick actions (create child, duplicate + relate)
- Relationship validation (prevent circular dependencies)
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Edit quantity/unit inline (currently placeholder button)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Hierarchy Detection** - Only detects relationships with "Parent", "Contains", or "Has" in label
2. **Max Depth** - Hierarchy limited to 3 levels to prevent performance issues
3. **No Caching** - Hierarchy fetched every time tab is opened (could cache)
4. **Edit Modal** - Edit quantity/unit button shows but functionality not implemented
5. **Search** - Add relationship modal doesn't have live search yet
6. **Pagination** - No pagination for large relationship lists

---

## üìù Configuration

### Section Visibility
Controlled via Entry Layout Builder:
- Navigate to: `/entry-layout-builder/<entry_type_id>`
- Toggle "relationships" section on/off
- Adjust grid position (x, y, width, height)

### Relationship Definitions
Managed via: `/manage_relationship_definitions`
- Create custom relationship types
- Set cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many)
- Enable/disable quantity/unit fields
- Define labels for both sides of relationship

---

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Recursive Templates** - Jinja2 macros work great for tree structures
2. **Lazy Loading** - Only load hierarchy when tab is activated saves bandwidth
3. **Bidirectional Logic** - Need to query both directions and use appropriate labels
4. **Tree Traversal** - Prevent infinite loops with visited set and max depth
5. **State Management** - Use data attributes to track loaded state
6. **Responsive Design** - Grid to flexbox for mobile is clean approach

---

## üìö Dependencies

- Bootstrap 5.3.3 (tabs, modals, grid)
- Font Awesome 6.0 (icons)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery)
- Jinja2 templating
- SQLite database
- Flask backend

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. Ensure database has `EntryRelationship` and `RelationshipDefinition` tables
2. CSS file must be served from `/static/css/sections/relationships.css`
3. JS file must be served from `/static/js/relationships-section.js`
4. API endpoints require authentication (uses `@login_required`)
5. Entry type must have relationships section enabled in layout

---

## üìû Support

For issues or questions about this implementation:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints return data: `/api/entries/<id>/relationships/incoming`
3. Check section_config in template context
4. Ensure relationships exist in database for testing
