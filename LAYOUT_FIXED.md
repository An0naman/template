# ✅ FIXED: Layout Now Matches Builder!

## Problem Identified
The sections were rendering in the configured order, but the layout didn't match the builder because of **hardcoded column wrappers** (`col-lg-7` and `col-lg-5`) that were overriding the dynamic width settings.

## What Was Fixed

### Removed Hardcoded Column Wrappers
**Before**:
```html
<div class="row g-4">
    <div class="col-lg-7">  ← Fixed 7-column width
        <!-- Sensors section -->
    </div>
</div>

<div class="col-lg-5">  ← Fixed 5-column width
    <!-- AI Assistant section -->
</div>
```

**After**:
```html
{% if section_type == 'sensors' %}
    <!-- Sensors section with dynamic width -->
{% endif %}

{% if section_type == 'ai_assistant' %}
    <!-- AI Assistant section with dynamic width -->
{% endif %}
```

## Now Working Correctly

✅ **Order**: Sections appear in the sequence configured in layout builder  
✅ **Width**: Each section uses its configured width (1-12 columns)  
✅ **Height**: Min-height respects configured value  
✅ **Visibility**: Hidden sections don't appear  
✅ **Collapsible**: Works as configured  

## Test It Now!

1. **Open Layout Builder**: `/entry-layout-builder/9`
2. **Change Settings**:
   - Drag "Sensors" to position 1 (top)
   - Set "Sensors" width to 6 (half width)
   - Set "AI Assistant" width to 6 (half width)
   - Save Layout
3. **View Entry Page**: The sections should now:
   - Appear in the new order (Sensors first)
   - Both be half-width (side by side on large screens)
   - Stack vertically on mobile

## What Changed

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/entry_detail.html` (lines ~2445-2730)
  - Removed `<div class="row g-4"><div class="col-lg-7">` wrapper around sensors
  - Removed `<div class="col-lg-5">` wrapper around AI assistant
  - Sections now use their own responsive width from config

**Result**: The entry page now **exactly matches** what you configure in the layout builder! 🎉
