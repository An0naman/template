# Status Dropdown Enhancement

## Changes Made

I've improved the status dropdown menus to clearly indicate which states are **Active** (ongoing) vs **Inactive** (completed).

## Updated Components

### 1. Index Page Filter (`app/templates/index.html`)

**Before:**
```html
<option value="">All Status</option>
<option value="active">Active</option>
<option value="inactive">Inactive</option>
```

**After:**
```html
<option value="">All Status</option>
<option value="active">✓ Active (Ongoing)</option>
<option value="inactive">✕ Inactive (Completed)</option>
```

### 2. Entry Detail Status Dropdown (`app/templates/entry_detail.html`)

**Before:**
- Flat list of all states with no grouping

**After:**
- States are grouped into two `<optgroup>` sections:
  - **✓ Active (Ongoing)** - Contains all states marked as "active" category
  - **✕ Inactive (Completed)** - Contains all states marked as "inactive" category

**Example Display:**
```
Status Dropdown:
├── ✓ Active (Ongoing)
│   ├── Primary Ferment
│   ├── Secondary Ferment
│   └── Conditioning
└── ✕ Inactive (Completed)
    ├── Racked
    ├── Bottled
    ├── Consumed
    └── Discarded
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **Check mark (✓)** indicates active/ongoing states
2. **Cross mark (✕)** indicates inactive/completed states
3. **Descriptive labels** in parentheses explain the meaning
4. **Grouped organization** makes it easier to find the right state
5. **Automatic grouping** based on the state's category field

## User Experience Benefits

- **Clearer intent**: Users immediately understand what "active" vs "inactive" means
- **Better organization**: Related states are grouped together
- **Visual indicators**: Symbols (✓/✕) provide quick visual cues
- **Context**: "(Ongoing)" and "(Completed)" explain the purpose
- **Consistency**: Same labeling used across both filter and entry forms

## Example Use Case

For a homebrewing app:
- When you see "✓ Active (Ongoing)", you know these are batches still in progress
- When you see "✕ Inactive (Completed)", you know these are finished batches

No more confusion about what "active" means!

## Files Modified
