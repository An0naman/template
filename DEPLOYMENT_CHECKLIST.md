## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Database Schema
Ensure these tables exist:
```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name IN ('Entry', 'EntryRelationship', 'RelationshipDefinition', 'EntryType');

-- Expected: All 4 tables should exist
```

### Step 2: Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Start Flask server
python run.py

# In another terminal, test endpoints:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/entries/1/relationships/incoming
curl http://localhost:5000/api/entries/1/relationships/grouped
curl http://localhost:5000/api/entries/1/relationships/hierarchy

# Expected: JSON responses (may need authentication token)
```

### Step 3: Verify Static Files
```bash
# Check CSS file exists and is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000/static/css/sections/relationships.css

# Check JS file exists and is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000/static/js/relationships-section.js

# Expected: File contents returned, not 404
```

### Step 4: Test V2 Route
```bash
# Access V2 entry detail page
xdg-open http://localhost:5000/entry/1/v2

# Or on macOS:
open http://localhost:5000/entry/1/v2

# Or on Windows:
start http://localhost:5000/entry/1/v2
```

### Step 5: Browser Verification
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for initialization message:
   ```
   "Initializing relationships section for entry: 1"
   ```
3. Verify no red error messages
4. Check Network tab - all resources load with 200 status

### Step 6: Enable Section in Layout
1. Navigate to: `/entry-layout-builder/<entry_type_id>`
2. Find "relationships" section
3. Toggle visibility ON
4. Adjust position/size if needed
5. Click "Save Layout"

### Step 7: Create Test Data (if needed)
```python
# In Python console
from app import create_app, get_db

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    conn = get_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create test relationship
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO EntryRelationship 
        (source_entry_id, target_entry_id, relationship_type)
        VALUES (1, 2, 1)
    """)
    
    conn.commit()
    print("Test relationship created!")
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Basic Functionality
- [ ] Open `/entry/<id>/v2`
- [ ] Verify "Related Records" section appears
- [ ] Check tab counts are accurate
- [ ] Switch between tabs - all work

### Test 2: Outgoing Relationships
- [ ] Outgoing tab shows relationships
- [ ] Grouped by relationship type
- [ ] Cards display correctly
- [ ] Delete button works
- [ ] Entry links open in new tab

### Test 3: Incoming Relationships
- [ ] Incoming tab loads
- [ ] Shows correct relationships
- [ ] Uses appropriate labels
- [ ] All features work like outgoing

### Test 4: Hierarchy View
- [ ] Hierarchy tab loads via AJAX
- [ ] Tree structure renders
- [ ] Expand/collapse works
- [ ] Current entry highlighted
- [ ] No console errors

### Test 5: Add Relationship
- [ ] Modal opens when clicking "Add Relationship"
- [ ] Relationship definitions load
- [ ] Entry selection works
- [ ] Submit creates relationship
- [ ] Page reloads and shows new relationship

### Test 6: Edge Cases
- [ ] Entry with no relationships shows empty state
- [ ] Entry with only incoming relationships
- [ ] Entry with only outgoing relationships
- [ ] Deep hierarchy (3+ levels)
- [ ] Large number of relationships (20+)

### Test 7: Mobile Responsive
- [ ] Resize browser to mobile width
- [ ] All elements visible
- [ ] Tabs work on mobile
- [ ] Cards stack properly
- [ ] Buttons accessible

### Test 8: Dark Mode
- [ ] Toggle dark mode
- [ ] All colors adapt
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Hover states work

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback by:

### Option 1: Disable Section
1. Go to Entry Layout Builder
2. Hide "relationships" section
3. Save layout
4. Section won't appear on entry pages

### Option 2: Revert Files
```bash
# Revert specific files if needed
git checkout HEAD -- app/api/relationships_api.py
git checkout HEAD -- app/routes/main_routes.py
git checkout HEAD -- app/templates/entry_detail_v2.html

# Remove new files
rm app/templates/sections/_relationships_section.html
rm app/templates/sections/_relationship_card.html
rm app/templates/sections/_relationship_tree.html
rm app/templates/modals/_add_relationship_modal.html
rm app/static/css/sections/relationships.css
rm app/static/js/relationships-section.js
```

### Option 3: Feature Flag
Add system parameter:
```python
# In system parameters
'enable_relationships_v2': False
```

Then in template:
```jinja2
{% if system_params.get('enable_relationships_v2', True) %}
    {% include 'sections/_relationships_section.html' %}
{% else %}
    <!-- Old relationships display -->
{% endif %}
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Page load time (should be < 2 seconds)
- API response time (< 1 second)
- JavaScript errors (should be zero)
- User complaints about relationships section
- Database query performance

### Log Messages to Monitor
```
# Good:
"GET /entry/123/v2 200"
"GET /api/entries/123/relationships/hierarchy 200"

# Bad:
"GET /api/entries/123/relationships/hierarchy 500"
"TypeError in relationships_api.py"
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Hierarchy Not Loading
**Symptom:** Loading spinner never disappears  
**Cause:** No parent-child relationships detected  
**Workaround:** Check relationship definitions have "Parent" in label_from_side

### Issue 2: Empty States Don't Show
**Symptom:** Blank section instead of empty state  
**Cause:** Template variable not passed correctly  
**Workaround:** Verify `relationships` dict exists in template context

### Issue 3: Delete Doesn't Work
**Symptom:** Delete button does nothing  
**Cause:** JavaScript not initialized  
**Workaround:** Check console for initialization message, verify JS file loaded
