# Niimbot Printer Integration - Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

You now have **full Niimbot B1 and D110 printer support** with:

1. **Two new printer options** in the label type dropdown
2. **Bluetooth printer discovery** - finds printers automatically
3. **Direct printing** to Niimbot printers via Bluetooth
4. **Configurable settings**:
   - Label size selection (30√ó15mm, 40√ó12mm, 50√ó14mm, 75√ó12mm)
   - Print density (1-5)
   - Quantity control (1-10 copies)
5. **Label preview** optimized for thermal printers
6. **Smart label generation** with QR codes

## üîß How to Use It

### Running with Bluetooth Support

Because Docker has limitations with Bluetooth, run the app directly:

```bash
# Stop Docker
docker compose down

# Run with Bluetooth support
./run_with_bluetooth.sh
```

Access at: **http://localhost:5001**

### Printing to Niimbot

1. Turn on your Niimbot printer (blue light = pairing mode)
2. Go to any entry's details page
3. Select "Niimbot B1" or "Niimbot D110" from dropdown
4. Choose label size (default: 50mm √ó 14mm)
5. Adjust print density (3 is recommended)
6. Click "Discover Printers"
7. Select your printer from the list
8. Click "Preview Label" to see it first (optional)
9. Click "Print Label" to print!

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/services/niimbot_printer.py` - Bluetooth printer service
- `run_with_bluetooth.sh` - Script to run with Bluetooth
- `NIIMBOT_PRINTER_INTEGRATION.md` - Full documentation
- `INSTALL_NIIMBOT.md` - Installation guide
- `BLUETOOTH_DOCKER_ISSUES.md` - Docker + Bluetooth info

### Modified Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Added bleak for Bluetooth
- `app/api/labels_api.py` - Added Niimbot endpoints and label generation
- `app/static/label_printing.js` - Added Niimbot UI and printing
- `app/templates/entry_detail.html` - Added Niimbot options to dropdown
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added Bluetooth support (for attempts)
- `Dockerfile` - Added Bluetooth libraries

## üéØ Current Status

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Printer discovery
- ‚úÖ Printer selection
- ‚úÖ Label preview
- ‚úÖ Label generation
- ‚úÖ When running directly: Full Bluetooth connectivity

### Docker Limitation:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è BLE connections from Docker are unreliable
- ‚úÖ Solution: Use `./run_with_bluetooth.sh` instead

## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Run with Bluetooth (recommended for Niimbot)
./run_with_bluetooth.sh

# Or run in Docker (for everything else)
docker compose up -d

# Stop either one
docker compose down  # or Ctrl+C for direct mode
```

## üìä Technical Details

- **Protocol**: Based on NiimPrintX/Labbots implementation
- **Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) via bleak
- **Image**: Converted to 1-bit monochrome for thermal printing
- **Label Formats**: Multiple sizes supported per printer model
- **DPI**: 203 DPI for both B1 and D110

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No printers found"
- Check printer is on (blue LED)
- Check battery level
- Move closer to computer
- Try discovery again

### "Failed to connect"
- Make sure printer is in pairing mode
- Ensure no other device is connected to it
- If using Docker, switch to `./run_with_bluetooth.sh`
- Try restarting the printer

### "Bluetooth not available"
- Install bleak: `pip install bleak`
- Check Bluetooth is enabled on your system
- Run outside Docker for best results

## üìñ Documentation

- See `NIIMBOT_PRINTER_INTEGRATION.md` for complete documentation
- See `BLUETOOTH_DOCKER_ISSUES.md` for Docker/Bluetooth details
- See `INSTALL_NIIMBOT.md` for installation instructions

## üéâ Ready to Print!

Your Niimbot integration is complete and ready to use. Just run with `./run_with_bluetooth.sh` and start printing labels!
