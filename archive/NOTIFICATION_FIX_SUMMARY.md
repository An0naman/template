# Sensor Notification Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Sensor alarm notifications weren't being created because:
1. **Data Collection Issue**: Device polling was using hardcoded sensor types instead of configured mappings
2. **Missing Notification Triggers**: Sensor data wasn't triggering notification rule checks
3. **Type Mismatch**: Alarm rules were set for one sensor type, but data was stored with different type names

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Device Data Collection (`app/api/device_api.py`)

#### New Function: `extract_sensor_data_using_mappings()`
- Reads configured sensor mappings from `DeviceSensorMapping` table
- Extracts device data using the configured field paths (e.g., "sensor.temperature")
- Uses the configured sensor type names (e.g., "Temperature") for data storage
- Formats values with appropriate units

#### Updated Manual Polling Function:
- Now uses configured mappings instead of hardcoded sensor types
- Automatically triggers notification rule checks for each data point
- Provides warning if no mappings are configured

#### Updated Automatic Polling Function:
- Same improvements as manual polling
- Skips devices with no configured mappings
- Triggers notification checks during routine data collection

### 2. Added Notification Rule Checking
Both polling functions now call `check_sensor_rules()` for each sensor data point, ensuring:
- Notifications are triggered immediately when conditions are met
- All configured alarm rules are evaluated
- Cooldown periods are respected

## How This Fixes Your Issue

### Before (Broken):
1. Device sends `{"sensor": {"temperature": 25.5}}`
2. Polling stores data as sensor type "Temperature" (hardcoded)
3. You create alarm for sensor type "Temperature" 
4. Alarm triggers... but might not work due to type mismatches

### After (Fixed):
1. Device sends `{"sensor": {"temperature": 25.5}}`
2. You configure data point mapping: `"sensor.temperature" â†’ "Temperature"`
3. Polling uses mapping to store data as sensor type "Temperature"
4. You create alarm for sensor type "Temperature"
5. **Perfect match** - alarm triggers correctly!

## Required Actions

### 1. Configure Data Points
For each device:
1. Go to **Manage Devices**
2. Click **Configure Data Points** for your device
3. Enable the data fields you want to track
4. Choose appropriate sensor type names

### 2. Verify Sensor Alarm Rules
1. Go to **Manage Sensor Alarms**
2. Ensure sensor type names match your data point configuration exactly
3. Check that rules are active and conditions are appropriate

### 3. Test the System
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
python diagnose_sensor_notifications.py
```

This will show you:
- Which devices have data point mappings
- Which sensor types are being created
- Whether alarm rules match the data
- Recent sensor data and notifications

## Additional Benefits

1. **Accurate Data Collection**: Only collects data you've explicitly configured
2. **Consistent Naming**: Sensor types match exactly what you choose
3. **Automatic Notifications**: No manual intervention needed
4. **Better Performance**: Skips devices with no configured mappings
5. **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear diagnostic tools to troubleshoot issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Test**: Use "Poll Device" button in Manage Devices to trigger immediate data collection
2. **Check Logs**: Monitor application logs for any error messages
3. **Verify Data**: Check entry sensor data to confirm correct type names
4. **Test Notifications**: Create a test alarm with easy-to-trigger conditions

The notification system should now work correctly with your configured sensor types!
