# Configurable Entry States - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Feature Completed!

I've successfully implemented a configurable state system for entries in your template project. This replaces the hardcoded "active"/"inactive" status with a flexible system where you can define custom states for each entry type.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **New `EntryState` table** with fields:
  - `name`: State display name (e.g., "Primary Ferment")
  - `category`: "active" or "inactive" (for filtering)
  - `color`: Hex color code for display
  - `display_order`: Sort order in dropdowns
  - `is_default`: Whether this is the default for new entries
  - `entry_type_id`: Links state to specific entry type

- **Migration Logic**: Automatically creates default "Active" and "Inactive" states for all existing entry types

### 2. API Endpoints (`app/api/entry_state_api.py`)
- `GET /api/entry_types/{id}/states` - List all states for an entry type
- `POST /api/entry_types/{id}/states` - Create new state
- `PUT /api/entry_types/{id}/states/{state_id}` - Update state
- `DELETE /api/entry_types/{id}/states/{state_id}` - Delete state
- `GET /api/entries/{id}/available_states` - Get states for a specific entry

### 3. Management UI (`app/templates/manage_entry_types.html`)
- **"Manage States" button** added to each entry type row
- **States Modal** with:
  - Visual list of all states with colors
  - Add new state form
  - Edit existing states
  - Delete states (with validation)
  - Drag-and-drop friendly display

### 4. Entry Forms Updated
- **entry_detail.html**: Status dropdown now loads states dynamically based on entry type
- **index.html**: Entries display with colored state badges
- **entry_api.py**: New entries automatically use the default state for their type

### 5. Filtering Enhanced
- Status filter now works with state categories (active/inactive)
- Entries can be filtered by active or inactive category
- Color-coded badges show state visually

## 🎨 Your Homebrewing Example

Now you can set up your homebrewing entry type with states like:

### Active States (Ongoing):
- **Primary Ferment** - Green (#28a745) - Default
- **Secondary Ferment** - Blue (#17a2b8)
- **Conditioning** - Light Blue (#0d6efd)

### Inactive States (Completed):
- **Racked** - Yellow (#ffc107)
- **Bottled** - Orange (#fd7e14)
- **Consumed** - Gray (#6c757d)
- **Discarded** - Red (#dc3545)

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Access State Management
1. Go to **Settings** → **Data Structure** → **Entry Types**
2. Find your entry type (e.g., "Batch" or "Brew")
3. Click the **🗹 Manage States** button

### Step 2: Add Custom States
1. Click **"Add New State"**
2. Enter state name (e.g., "Primary Ferment")
3. Choose category: Active or Inactive
4. Pick a color for the badge
5. Set display order (0 = first)
6. Check "Set as default" if this should be the initial state
7. Click **"Save State"**

### Step 3: Use States in Entries
- New entries automatically use the default state
- Edit any entry to change its state
- States dropdown only shows states for that entry's type
- Filter the main list by Active/Inactive categories

## 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

- All existing entries keep their current status
- Default "Active" and "Inactive" states are automatically created
- No data loss or breaking changes

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/api/entry_state_api.py` - State management API
- `docs/CONFIGURABLE_STATES.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files:
- `app/db.py` - Added EntryState table + migration
- `app/__init__.py` - Registered new blueprint
- `app/api/entry_api.py` - Use default states for new entries
- `app/routes/main_routes.py` - Include state info in queries
- `app/templates/manage_entry_types.html` - State management UI
- `app/templates/entry_detail.html` - Dynamic state loading
- `app/templates/index.html` - Color-coded state badges

## 🚀 System is Ready!

The Docker container has been rebuilt and is running successfully. You can now:

1. **Navigate to `/manage_entry_types`** to start configuring states
2. **Create custom states** for your homebrewing or any other entry types
3. **Assign states to entries** with custom colors and meanings
4. **Filter entries** by state category
