# Quick Answer: Yes, It's Integrated! üéâ

## What Changed in Your App

### File: `app/api/labels_api.py`

**3 lines changed** to use the new working BLE service:

```python
# Line ~875 - Discover endpoint
- from ..services.niimbot_printer import discover_niimbot_printers
+ from ..services.niimbot_printer_ble import discover_niimbot_printers

# Line ~910 - Connect endpoint  
- from ..services.niimbot_printer import NiimbotPrinter
+ from ..services.niimbot_printer_ble import NiimbotPrinterBLE as NiimbotPrinter

# Line ~963 - Print endpoint
- from ..services.niimbot_printer import NiimbotPrinter
+ from ..services.niimbot_printer_ble import NiimbotPrinterBLE as NiimbotPrinter
```

## What This Means

### Before (Broken)
```
Your App ‚Üí Old RFCOMM Service ‚Üí ‚ùå Doesn't work with B1
```

### Now (Working!)
```
Your App ‚Üí New BLE Service ‚Üí ‚úÖ Prints to B1 successfully!
```

## How to Use It

### From Your Frontend:

```javascript
// Print a label to B1
fetch('/api/entries/123/niimbot/print', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    printer_address: 'B1',      // or '13:07:12:A6:40:07'
    printer_model: 'b1',        // or 'd110'
    label_size: '50x14mm',
    density: 3,
    quantity: 1
  })
});
```

### From Command Line:

```bash
# Start your app
docker compose up

# Print a label
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/entries/1/niimbot/print \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"printer_address": "B1", "printer_model": "b1"}'
```

## That's It!

‚úÖ Your existing API routes now use the working BLE service  
‚úÖ B1 printer will physically print labels  
‚úÖ No other code changes needed  

Just restart your Docker container to pick up the changes:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

---

**TL;DR: YES, it's integrated! Your app can now print to B1/D110 printers via the existing `/api/entries/<id>/niimbot/print` endpoint.**
