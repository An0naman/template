# Timeline Section - Quick Summary

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Task:** Implement Progress Timeline Section  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Built

A comprehensive **Progress Timeline Section** that displays the complete history of an entry in a visually appealing, chronological format.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Visual Progress Tracking**
- Animated progress bar (0-100%)
- Color-coded by completion: Green → Blue → Yellow → Red
- Shows: days elapsed, total days, days remaining/overdue
- Only displays if entry type has `show_end_dates` enabled

### 2. **Event Timeline**
Displays all entry activities in reverse chronological order:

| Event Type | Icon | Color | What It Shows |
|------------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Creation** | ➕ | Blue (primary) | When entry was created |
| **Status Change** | 🔄 | Yellow (warning) | Status transitions (auto-tracked) |
| **Notes** | 📝 | Blue (info) | User-added notes |
| **Sensors** | 🌡️ | Green (success) | Sensor readings (grouped by day) |
| **System** | ⚙️ | Gray (secondary) | System events |

### 3. **Smart Filtering**
Four filter buttons to focus on specific events:
- **All** - Everything
- **Notes** - Only user notes  
- **Sensors** - Only sensor data
- **System** - System events + status changes

### 4. **Data Integration**
Pulls from multiple sources:
- Entry metadata (creation date, end dates)
- Notes API (`/api/entries/{id}/notes`)
- Sensor Data API (`/api/entries/{id}/sensor_data`)
- Auto-generated status change notes

## File Details

**Location:** `/app/templates/sections/_timeline_section.html`  
**Size:** 495 lines  
**Components:**
- HTML structure (64 lines)
- CSS styling (120 lines)
- JavaScript logic (311 lines)

---

## How It Works

### On Page Load:
1. **Fetch Data** - Parallel API calls for notes and sensors
2. **Build Timeline** - Combine all events into unified array
3. **Calculate Progress** - If end dates exist, compute metrics
4. **Render Events** - Display sorted timeline with visual markers
5. **Enable Filters** - Attach event handlers to filter buttons

### Timeline Events Include:
- ✅ Entry creation timestamp
- ✅ All notes (with type badges)
- ✅ Status changes (from system notes)
- ✅ Sensor readings (grouped by day)
- ✅ Relative time display ("2h ago", "3d ago")

## Visual Design

```
Progress Timeline Section
├── Section Header
│   ├── Title with history icon
│   └── Filter buttons (All | Notes | Sensors | System)
│
├── Progress Card (conditional - if end dates exist)
│   ├── Date range (Created → Target)
│   ├── Animated progress bar with percentage
│   └── Metrics (elapsed, total, remaining)
│
└── Timeline Events (vertical)
    ├── Colored dot markers on vertical line
    ├── Event cards with hover effects
    ├── Timestamp (relative + absolute on hover)
    └── Event-specific content
        ├── Status changes: old → new
        ├── Notes: title + content + type badge
        └── Sensors: readings with values
```

---

## Status Change Tracking

The system **automatically creates notes** when status changes:

**When:** Entry status is updated via API  
**What:** Creates a "System" type note with:
- Title: "Status Change"
- Content: "Status automatically changed from 'X' to 'Y'"
- Type: "System"

These appear in the timeline as **status change events** (yellow marker).

## Example Timeline Display

```
🔵 Entry Created                                     27 days ago
   Entry "My Project" was created

🟡 Status Change                                     2 hours ago
   Status automatically changed from 'Active' to 'In Progress'
   [System]

🔵 Note Added                                        1 day ago
   Weekly progress update - on track!
   [General]

🟢 Sensor Readings                                   2 days ago
   5 sensor reading(s) recorded
   Temperature: 22.5°C | Humidity: 45% | ...

🔵 Note Added                                        5 days ago
   Initial project setup complete
