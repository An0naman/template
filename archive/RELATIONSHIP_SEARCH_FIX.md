# Relationship Search Fix - Type Coercion Issue

## Problem Summary
When searching for entries to create relationships (e.g., searching for "Ingredient" from a "Sample Bottle"), the search would sometimes return no results even though appropriate entries existed. The issue was caused by **inconsistent type handling** when comparing entry type IDs.

## Root Cause
Throughout `app/templates/entry_detail.html`, entry type comparisons were using loose equality (`==`) instead of strict equality (`===`). This caused potential type coercion issues where:
- `currentEntryTypeId` might be a string (e.g., "5")
- `entry_type_id_from` or `entry_type_id_to` from the API might be integers (e.g., 5)
- While `==` typically handles this, edge cases and browser differences could cause failures

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/templates/entry_detail.html`

### Specific Changes

#### 1. **Line ~5822-5825**: Relationship Definition Filtering
**Before:**
```javascript
const relevantDefinitions = definitions.filter(def => 
    def.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId || def.entry_type_id_to == currentEntryTypeId
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const relevantDefinitions = definitions.filter(def => 
    def.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId) || def.entry_type_id_to === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId)
);
```

#### 2. **Line ~5838**: Render Related Records - isFromSide Check
**Before:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = def.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = def.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId);
```

#### 3. **Line ~6248**: Add Existing Entry Modal - Target Type Determination
**Before:**
```javascript
const isCurrentEntryFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isCurrentEntryFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId);
```

#### 4. **Line ~6583**: Create New Entry and Relationship
**Before:**
```javascript
const isCurrentEntryFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isCurrentEntryFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId);
```

#### 5. **Line ~7268**: Shared Relationships Cardinality Check (First Instance)
**Before:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId);
```

#### 6. **Line ~7743**: Shared Relationships Cardinality Check (Second Instance)
**Before:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from == currentEntryTypeId;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isFromSide = relationshipDef.entry_type_id_from === parseInt(currentEntryTypeId);
```

## Impact

### What This Fixes
1. **Bidirectional Relationship Search**: Searching for entries now works correctly in both directions
2. **Type Safety**: Ensures all entry type ID comparisons are type-safe with explicit integer conversion
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All relationship-related type comparisons now use the same pattern

### Example Scenario
- **Before**: Searching for "Ingredient" from a "Sample Bottle" might fail if type coercion didn't work properly
- **After**: Both directions work reliably:
  - Searching for "Ingredient" from "Sample Bottle" ✓
  - Searching for "Sample Bottle" from "Ingredient" ✓

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Bidirectional Relationships**:
   - Create a relationship definition between two entry types (e.g., Ingredient ↔ Sample Bottle)
   - From an Ingredient entry, search for and add a Sample Bottle
   - From a Sample Bottle entry, search for and add an Ingredient
   - Verify both directions work correctly

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Entries with single-digit IDs
   - Entries with multi-digit IDs
   - Relationships with cardinality constraints

3. **Test Shared Relationships**:
   - Verify that shared relationship opportunities display correctly
   - Check that cardinality limits are enforced properly

## Technical Notes

### Why `parseInt()`?
Using `parseInt()` ensures that:
1. String representations of numbers are converted to integers
2. Comparisons are always done between same types
3. The code is explicit about type expectations

### Why `===` instead of `==`?
Strict equality (`===`) prevents unexpected type coercion:
- More predictable behavior
- Catches type mismatches early
- Industry best practice for JavaScript
